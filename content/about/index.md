## About

I’m Nigel Surtees, based in the UK. This site is my personal learning log and project journal for vintage audio restoration and audio-electronics fundamentals.

My main long-running project is the **Rotel RM-5010** (referred to throughout the site as **RM**) — documenting diagnosis, repairs, upgrades, and the lessons learned along the way. I created this site to keep the information structured and searchable, and to share practical methods that may help others working on similar equipment.

## What you’ll find here

- Project notes and service-style writeups for the RM-5010
- Restoration work logs (fault symptoms, measurements, test setups, and outcomes)
- Technical notes and learning resources developed as I go
