## What this is

This site is a structured, practical learning notebook focused on **audio electronics** and **Hi-Fi systems**.

It is not a textbook, and it is not a collection of random notes.
It is a guided progression built around:
- Real circuits
- Real failure modes
- Real diagnostic thinking

The emphasis is on *understanding design intent* and *reasoning safely*, not memorising formulas.

## Who this is for

This material is written for:
- Hobbyists restoring vintage Hi-Fi equipment
- Engineers who want a stronger intuitive grasp of analogue audio circuits
- Anyone who learns best by connecting theory to real hardware

If you enjoy asking *“why did the designer do it this way?”*, you’re in the right place.

## How to use this site

Each **phase** builds on the previous one.

Within each phase you’ll find:
- Short, focused lessons
- Real-world examples from audio equipment
- Diagnostic challenges
- Reflection prompts to consolidate understanding

You don’t need to rush.
Depth matters more than speed.

## Where to start

Begin with **Phase 1 — Foundations**.
Even experienced engineers often discover gaps here that quietly affect everything else.
