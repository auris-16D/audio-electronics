status: "active"
summary: "Signal-first electronics fundamentals and audio-focused diagnostic training, progressing from conceptual models to real fault diagnosis."
---

## Purpose

This learning framework is designed to develop the capability to:

- Understand electronics fundamentals deeply and correctly
- Apply that understanding to diagnose and repair audio equipment, including vintage designs
- Think like an electronics engineer, even in an amateur context

The framework is **interactive**, **incremental**, and **diagnosis-driven**.

---

## Core Aims

### Aim 1 — Electronics fundamentals (audio-biased)
Develop a correct mental model of:
- electrical signals
- references and grounding
- components and their non-ideal behaviour
- how circuits behave as systems

Audio is used as a **concrete context**, not a limitation.

---

### Aim 2 — Diagnosing and understanding audio electronics
Apply fundamentals to:
- real schematics
- real faults
- real constraints (aging parts, incomplete information, safety)

Diagnosis is treated as a **thinking discipline**, not a checklist.

---

## Instruction Model

Lessons follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Calibration**
   - 2–3 adaptive questions
   - Purpose: reveal existing mental models and assumptions

2. **Synthesis**
   - A written lesson reflecting the calibrated understanding
   - Persisted to the site as a reference artifact

3. **Assessment (at strategic points)**
   - Real fault scenarios
   - No diagnosis provided initially
   - Interactive guidance available on request
   - Correct diagnosis and reasoning revealed

## Framework Phases (Overview)

### Phase 1 — Signal-Centric Foundations
Signals, reference, gain, stages, and measurement intent.

### Phase 1.5 — Functional Patterns (Bridge)
Recognising stages and common component groupings on schematics.

### Phase 2 — Passive Components in Context
Resistors, capacitors, inductors as signal-shaping tools.

### Phase 3 — Active Devices as Signal Controllers
Transistors understood by behaviour and role, not physics-first.

### Phase 4 — Power, Reference, and Stability
Power supplies, grounding, decoupling, noise, protection.

### Phase 5 — Measurement & Test Equipment (Integrated)
Multimeter, oscilloscope, generators — introduced only when thinking supports them.

### Phase 6 — System-Level Audio Circuits
Complete preamps, tone stages, power amps, feedback.

### Phase 7 — Guided Fault Diagnosis
Interactive diagnosis of real faults with staged reveal.

### Phase 8 — Vintage Reality & Failure Modes
Aging, drift, prior repairs, risk-based decisions.

### Phase 9 — Generalisation Beyond Audio
Applying the same reasoning to non-audio electronics.

## Design Principle

> **Signals define the problem space; components are the tools that shape them.**

Nothing in the framework violates this rule.
