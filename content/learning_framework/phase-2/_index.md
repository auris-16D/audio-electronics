title: "Phase 2 — Passive Components in Context"
section: "Learning Framework"
status: "planned"
summary: "Understand passive components as signal-shaping tools."
---

## Purpose

Introduce passive components in service of signal behaviour and failure modes.

## Covered Concepts
- Resistors: roles, noise, drift
- Capacitors: coupling, bypassing, aging
- Inductors and transformers
- Passive networks as functional blocks

## Outcomes

After completing this phase, you should be able to:
- Reason confidently about the concepts introduced in this phase
- Apply them to audio-focused electronics problems
- Prepare for the next phase without conceptual gaps

## Notes

This phase is part of the Audio Electronics Learning Framework.
