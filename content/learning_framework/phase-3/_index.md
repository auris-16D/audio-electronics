title: "Phase 3 — Active Devices as Signal Controllers"
section: "Learning Framework"
status: "planned"
summary: "Understand transistors by behaviour and role, not physics-first."
---

## Purpose

Introduce active devices as controlled elements within signal paths.

## Covered Concepts
- Amplification and buffering
- Biasing as enabling AC operation
- Typical transistor stages
- Non-ideal behaviour relevant to audio

## Outcomes

After completing this phase, you should be able to:
- Reason confidently about the concepts introduced in this phase
- Apply them to audio-focused electronics problems
- Prepare for the next phase without conceptual gaps

## Notes

This phase is part of the Audio Electronics Learning Framework.
