title: "Phase 1.5 — Functional Patterns (Bridge Phase)"
section: "Learning Framework"
status: "planned"
summary: "Learn to recognise stages and functional groupings on schematics."
---

## Purpose

Bridge conceptual signal thinking to real component groupings seen on schematics.

## Covered Concepts
- What defines a stage electrically
- Common functional groupings
- Separating signal path from support circuitry
- Recognising boundaries on real schematics

## Outcomes

After completing this phase, you should be able to:
- Reason confidently about the concepts introduced in this phase
- Apply them to audio-focused electronics problems
- Prepare for the next phase without conceptual gaps

## Notes

This phase is part of the Audio Electronics Learning Framework.
