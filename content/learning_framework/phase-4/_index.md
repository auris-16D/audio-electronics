## Purpose

Understand how power, grounding, and stability affect circuit behaviour.

## Covered Concepts
- Linear power supplies and regulators
- Grounding strategies and pitfalls
- Decoupling and stability
- Noise, hum, and oscillation
- Protection circuits

## Outcomes

After completing this phase, you should be able to:
- Reason confidently about the concepts introduced in this phase
- Apply them to audio-focused electronics problems
- Prepare for the next phase without conceptual gaps

## Notes

This phase is part of the Audio Electronics Learning Framework.
