## Purpose

Apply the same reasoning framework to non-audio electronic systems.

## Covered Concepts
- Recognising familiar patterns in new domains
- Knowing where audio intuition no longer applies

## Outcomes

After completing this phase, you should be able to:
- Reason confidently about the concepts introduced in this phase
- Apply them to audio-focused electronics problems
- Prepare for the next phase without conceptual gaps

## Notes

This phase is part of the Audio Electronics Learning Framework.
