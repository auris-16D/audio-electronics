title: "Phase 1 — Signal-Centric Foundations"
section: "Learning Framework"
status: "complete"
summary: "Build correct mental models of signals before introducing components or maths."
---

## Purpose

Establish a signal-first way of thinking about electronics, using audio as the primary context.

## Covered Concepts
- AC vs DC signals
- Signal flow and block thinking
- Reference, ground, and return
- Gain and attenuation
- Measurement as intent-driven reasoning

## Outcomes

After completing this phase, you should be able to:
- Reason confidently about the concepts introduced in this phase
- Apply them to audio-focused electronics problems
- Prepare for the next phase without conceptual gaps

## Notes

This phase is part of the Audio Electronics Learning Framework.
