<!-- # Rotel RM-5010 – Service Report -->

**Scope:** Electrical & mechanical restoration

## Mechanical work

### Cabinet

- Several repairs to structure from previous hard impact event. Epoxy resin and brackets to ensure future structural integrity.

- Cleaned all areas including soaking and cleaning all knobs. Removed glass display to clean reverse side.

- Replace the AC incandescent  illumination system with new DC led system. 8 LEDs in total. 4 for main glass tuner display, 2 for tuner gauge, 1 each per VU meter. System can be dimmed using dimmer on rear of case. 0.5 amp fuse located next to dimmer. Warm LEDs used in keeping with original system.

- Removable (velcro'd) holder for Spare fuses and full set warm white LEDs mounted on rear of cabinet. 2 x 3.15 amp speaker fuses and 1 x 0.5 amp fuse for LED circuit. 8 LEDs.

### Switches and potentiometers (Rotary controls)
- Main power switch sticking and barely working. Cleaned and freed with electrical contact and switch cleaner. Now working as it should.
- Bass, treble and Volume controls were all very noisy in use. Cleaned with electrical contact and switch cleaner, working as they should now.
- Balance control broken internally and mechanically. Decision made to disconnect and leave in place so the control knob has something to attach to. 

### Turntable

- Tonearm mounting stripped realigned and adjusted to smooth operation. Centralised in mount for correct lateral movement as arm tracks start to end of record.

- Lift mechanism stripped cleaned and damping oil applied to piston. Reassembled and adjust to correct lift height and orientation.

- Tonearm base adjusted correctly to orientated the arm and illuminate horizontal and vertical movement of mounting arm shaft.

- Tonearm locking mechanisim not holding tonearm. This was gently warmed and persuaded back to its original form. Now holds tonearm firmly.

- Replaced cartridge and stylus for Goldring G800. Set correct tracking weight.

- Cartridge aligned using baerwald printable protractor.

- Adjust 33 & 45 to correct speeds using built in strobe.

## Electronics work

### Power supply PCB

- Pre/Post measurements report

- Replaced all Capacitors

### Preamplifier PCB

- Replaced all Capacitors 

- Replaced transistors in all stages (4), 8 in total. 

- Disconnected balance potentiometer as internally broken

- Tested volume potentiometer, slight imbalance, left alone.

### Phono PCB

- Replaced all Capacitors 

- Tuner/source selector PCB

- Replaced all Capacitors 

### Cassette deck PCB

- Replaced all Capacitors 

- Replaced 4 transistors 

### Power Amplifer PCB

- Replaced all Capacitors 

### LED system

- 2nd iteration. 1st used PWM as suggested by ChatGPT and caused major interference on FM mode and introduced noise to audio.

- New power supply PCB. Converted AC supply to DC with smoothing to iliminate ripple and therefore led flicker.

- New PCBs for each pair of LEDs, 4 on total.

- 2 x New PCBs for LED DC dimming and LED regulated DC supply. Dimmer potentiometer varies LED supply voltage.

- Mounted LEDs inside each VU meter. 

- Mounted dimmer and fuse holder and integrated into circuit.
