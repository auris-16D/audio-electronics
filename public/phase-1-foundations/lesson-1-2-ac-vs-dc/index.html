  <h1>Lesson 1.2 — AC vs DC in Audio Circuits</h1>
  <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>This lesson explains the fundamental distinction between <strong>AC signals</strong> and <strong>DC operating conditions</strong> in audio circuits.</p>
<p>Understanding this separation is essential for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal coupling</li>
<li>Biasing</li>
<li>Diagnosing “no sound” faults</li>
<li>Understanding why capacitors and protection circuits exist</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this lesson you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the role of DC in audio stages</li>
<li>Describe what the AC audio signal represents</li>
<li>Predict what happens when DC enters the signal path</li>
<li>Recognise DC-related faults without seeing a schematic</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-role-of-dc">The Role of DC</h2>
<p>DC exists to place circuit stages into a <strong>defined operating state</strong>.</p>
<p>At system level:</p>
<ul>
<li>DC powers stages</li>
<li>DC establishes bias points</li>
<li>DC defines headroom and linear operating regions</li>
</ul>
<p>DC does <strong>not</strong> carry audio information.</p>
<p>A useful rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DC creates the conditions for operation.<br>
AC carries the information.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each stage is designed around its own DC assumptions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-ac-audio-signal">The AC Audio Signal</h2>
<p>The AC audio signal represents <strong>time-varying information</strong>.</p>
<p>Conceptually:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is encoded media (music, speech)</li>
<li>It varies continuously with time</li>
</ul>
<p>Physically:</p>
<ul>
<li>It appears as small voltage and current variations</li>
<li>It spans a range of frequencies</li>
<li>It is reproduced stage by stage, not “pushed” through the circuit</li>
</ul>
<p>In early stages, the AC signal carries very little energy — it is almost entirely informational.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-ac-and-dc-must-be-separated">Why AC and DC Must Be Separated</h2>
<p>Each circuit stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires its own DC conditions</li>
<li>Is designed to manage and monitor those conditions internally</li>
</ul>
<p>Passing DC from one stage to the next is dangerous because:</p>
<ul>
<li>One stage’s DC level can shift the next stage’s bias point</li>
<li>DC can force stages into cutoff or saturation</li>
<li>DC can eliminate headroom and block AC entirely</li>
<li>DC at outputs can trigger protection or damage speakers</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Only AC information should be handed from one stage to the next.<br>
DC must be locally sourced and locally controlled.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This separation is intentional and fundamental.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="common-dc-related-failure-symptoms">Common DC-Related Failure Symptoms</h2>
<p>DC problems often present as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete loss of audio with normal power-up</li>
<li>Audio that appears briefly, then disappears</li>
<li>Protection relays that never engage</li>
<li>Silent channels with healthy power rails</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms frequently occur <strong>without visible damage</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key Takeaway</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AC is shared. DC is not.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each stage owns its DC requirements.<br>
The signal path exists to transfer information, not operating conditions.</p>
<p>Understanding this principle explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why coupling exists</li>
<li>Why leakage causes faults</li>
<li>Why many vintage “no sound” problems are DC problems in disguise</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where have you seen DC faults masquerade as signal faults?</li>
<li>How might this model change how you approach “no sound” repairs?</li>
<li>Which stages in a typical amplifier are most sensitive to DC errors?</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson underpins everything that follows.</p>
