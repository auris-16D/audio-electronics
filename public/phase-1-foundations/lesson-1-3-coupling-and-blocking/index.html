  <h1>Lesson 1.3 — Coupling and Blocking: Why Capacitors Exist</h1>
  <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>This lesson explains <strong>why coupling exists between audio stages</strong>, and why capacitors are used so pervasively in audio circuits.</p>
<p>It builds directly on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lesson 1.1 — Signal Flow</li>
<li>Lesson 1.2 — AC vs DC</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this lesson you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the behavioural requirements of a stage interface</li>
<li>Explain why DC must be blocked while AC is passed</li>
<li>Understand why frequency matters for coupling</li>
<li>Recognise classic capacitor-related failure symptoms</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-stage-interface-contract">The Stage Interface Contract</h2>
<p>In a well-designed audio system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each stage owns its <strong>DC operating conditions</strong></li>
<li>Stages exchange <strong>AC information only</strong></li>
<li>The interface between stages enforces this contract</li>
</ul>
<p>In behavioural terms, the interface must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass changing signals (AC)</li>
<li>Reject steady-state levels (DC)</li>
<li>Behave consistently regardless of what stage follows</li>
</ul>
<p>This separation is deliberate and fundamental.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-time-and-frequency-matter">Why Time and Frequency Matter</h2>
<p>DC is not a separate phenomenon from AC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DC is simply AC at 0 Hz.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has an important consequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very slow AC begins to resemble DC</li>
<li>An interface that blocks DC must therefore also attenuate <em>very low frequencies</em></li>
<li>Faster changes are easier to pass cleanly</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An AC-passing / DC-blocking interface can never be frequency-neutral.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject 0 Hz completely</li>
<li>Attenuate very low frequencies first</li>
<li>Pass higher frequencies more easily</li>
</ul>
<p>This behaviour is unavoidable and must be designed around.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="real-world-consequences">Real-World Consequences</h2>
<p>Because slow changes are affected first, coupling problems often present as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak or missing bass</li>
<li>Thin or “tinny” sound</li>
<li>Audio that fades in after power-on</li>
<li>Channels that work intermittently</li>
<li>Silence despite healthy power rails</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stage itself may be functional</li>
<li>The fault exists at the <strong>interface</strong></li>
<li>No component needs to be completely open or shorted</li>
</ul>
<p>Partial degradation is enough.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-capacitors-are-used">Why Capacitors Are Used</h2>
<p>A capacitor is the simplest device that naturally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks steady-state voltage (DC)</li>
<li>Responds to change (AC)</li>
<li>Responds more strongly to faster change than slower change</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it a natural implementation of the stage interface contract.</p>
<p>Capacitors are not arbitrary parts added “for sound” — they exist to enforce <strong>DC independence between stages</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key Takeaway</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Coupling is not about passing signal.<br>
It is about preventing DC from propagating.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loss of bass, delayed audio, and silent channels are often <strong>DC problems expressed as AC symptoms</strong>.</p>
<p>Understanding this makes capacitor placement — and capacitor failure — intelligible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where in your equipment have you seen bass loss without total failure?</li>
<li>How might this explain “it works after warming up” faults?</li>
<li>Which stages in an amplifier are most sensitive to coupling behaviour?</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson sets the stage for understanding real capacitor choices and failures.</p>
